This application is developed for Coursera - 'Developing Data Products' course assignment. Application was built on mtcars dataset. 

User can do **'Exploratory Data Analysis'** and **'Linear Regression'** with this dataset using this application. For this study, outcome is miles per gallon (mpg). 

For each tab steps are mentioned below:

 1. **Exploratory Analysis** - In this tab, user can prepare line chart or boxplot of various variable against miles per gallon (mpg). User have to select type of chart he/she would like to create. Once chart is selected user can select x-axis (against which mpg should be plotted). In case of line chart, user can also select category against which grouping can be done in plot.

 2. **Model Fitting** - In this tab, user can select input variable(s) (more than one) using which linear regression model will be prepared for mpg as outcome. User can see actual value and fitted value in tabular format where fitted value is predicted using linear regression.
